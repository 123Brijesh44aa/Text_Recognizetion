# Text_Recognizetion
This Application is used to Recognize text from Images, you can capture Image using Camera and it will process the image using 
Google's Machine learning kit  and return a Text Object which contain Image Text , and it will show recognized text in another activity . 
I used Shared Preferences to send Text Object from Main Activity to Detail Activity. 

<< Features of Application>>
camera Button -> used to capture image.
Text View -> detail Activity contain a TextView which is used to show recognized Text data.


thank you.
